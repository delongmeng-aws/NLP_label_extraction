### Natural Language Entity Extraction and Question Answering Using BERT

In this project we'll extract information from unstructured medical text. In particular:

Extracting disease labels from clinical reports
- Text matching
- Evaluating a labeler
- Negation detection
- Dependency parsing

Question Answering with BERT
- Preprocessing text for input
- Extracting answers from model output

This project is inspired by this [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031) done by Irvin et al.
